## About

`PlantyPlant` is a deep learning project aimed at detecting plant diseases from images. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories.

---

## Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation  
- CNN model architecture for classification  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Prediction on new plant leaf images  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV  
- **Environment Management:** `venv` or `conda`
